    <h1>Mini Calculator App</h1>
    <p>In this project, you are going to develop a calculator that will have the following features:

        It will perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication.for example if we give 5+3 it will display 8 as answer.
        It will perform decimal operations.
        The calculator will display Infinity if you try to divide any number by zero.
        It will not display any result in case of invalid expression. For example, 5++9 will not display anything.
        Clear screen feature to clear the display screen anytime you want.<br>
    ex:1)5+3=8<br>
    2)5-3=2<br>
   3)5*3=15<br>
   4)6/3=2</p>
